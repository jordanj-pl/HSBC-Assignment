## Notes

I tried to present some skills as required per task description. There are some TODOs to show that I realize something more should be done but simply saying I did not have enough time last week. This project should proof that I have good understanding if design patterns, Interface Builder as well as building UI programatically. Unit test coverage is marginal but I hope it should be enough to determine my skills in writing testable code is enough.

If you believe something more should be done in order to check my suitability for the position please let me know, my contact data are dispalyed within the app - provided you have an Internet connection to download profile from remote server.

This app has been tested on iPhone X running iOS 13.5.
